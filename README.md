This work explores the potential of LLMs as coding tutors. We propose Trace-and-Verify (**Traver**), an effective agent workflow that incorporates knowledge tracing and turn-by-turn verification, to tackle key challenges in coding tutoring. While this work focuses on coding tutoring as an example, the proposed method extends beyond coding to other task-tutoring scenarios, where the tutor must adapt content to users' varying levels of background knowledge. We further introduce Dialogue for Coding Tutoring (**DICT**), a novel evaluation protocol combining student simulation and coding tests to assess tutor performance. Such automated evaluation is critical for developing task-tutoring agents as it supports a systematic development and evaluation cycle.

## Analysis of Simulated Students
Under a controlled setup, simulated students at different levels demonstrate distinct abilities in completing target coding tasks. Our DICT protocol serves as a feasible proxy for human evaluation, offering its advantages of scalability and cost-effectiveness for evaluating tutor agents.
